Earthquake Dashboard
----------------------
Hey ! This is a little project I put together to explore and visualize earthquake data. It’s built with React, Recharts, and Tailwind CSS. You can view a scatter plot of earthquake events and see all the data in a table below. If you hover on a chart point, the table will jump right to that row and highlight and vice versa.

How to Run
-----------
1. Clone the repo :
   git clone https://github.com/athulya4044/earthquake-dashboard.git
   cd earthquake-dashboard

2. Install the dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the application:
